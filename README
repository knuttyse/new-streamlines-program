The purpose is to draw a vector field for the superconducting current in a Bean critical state superconductor of rectangular interface. The algorithm is different from my previous project. The intent is to make a solution which scales better as the size of the system grows.

This is an unfinished project with many unfinished functions.
The functions are not have tests.
